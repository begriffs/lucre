# What's the fuss? Let them pay you!

How come only stores accept debit/credit cards? You should be able
to accept them too. Let your friends send you some money, or charge
for impromptu consulting. Just deploy this app to Heroku, change some
variables and you're in business.

This thing doesn't ask the customer much, just for an email
and the payment amount. All the credit card info stays on
[Stripe](https://stripe.com) so you have nothing to worry about.

You can see it in action [here](http://pay.begriffs.com). If you like
it, why not donate? ;)

## Installation

1. Get a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account and find your API keys.
1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Get a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account.
1. Deploy this app to a new Heroku instance.
1. Set the environment variables (see below).
1. Profit? Quite possibly.

For each variable below, set its value in your heroku instance by
running `$ heroku config:add VARIABLE_NAME=value`.

cards without issuing real charges. There are a variety of [test card

error or card event.
